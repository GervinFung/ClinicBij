# WAD Assignment

- npm install -g yarn (yarn is just better & I could not revert back to npm for the time being)
- `yarn install (install all dependencies)`
- `yarn start (start server)`
- `yarn test (execute test code)`

- If need convert back to `npm`? Should be able to do the same by deleting `node_module` and `yarn.lock`, and install with `npm`
- For now use `yarn`, because `yarn` is way better, it's also ok to use yarn for assignments/assessments/tests
